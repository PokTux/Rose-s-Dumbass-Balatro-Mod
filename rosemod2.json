  "description": "Originally I made a mod with like, 10 jokers, got bored of coding, stopped working on it, and never uploaded it. But joker forge is a thing now so enjoy these low quality and probably unbalanced Jokers that are mostly injokes, shitty memes, or references to random media I like. Unless otherwise stated all art is made using screenshots of the relevant meme/media, assets from the relevant media, official cover/promo art from the relevant media, images from official product listings, or Balatro assets I've modified in paint.net because I'm a scrooge and refuse to purchase Aseprite. If this mod gets popular enough I might like, make actual Joker art (by which I mean pestering the one pixel artist I know) instead of squishing down images in a way that completely breaks Balatro's art style. If for whatever reason you need to, you can contact me on discord at poktux#0178",
